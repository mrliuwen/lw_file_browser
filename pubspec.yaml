flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The androidPackage and pluginClass identifiers should not ordinarily
  # be modified. They are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.

    pluginClass: FileBrowserPlugin


  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/folder.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/image.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/morbit_chat_fiile_icon_ppt.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/morbit_chat_fiile_icon_word.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/morbit_chat_fiile_icon_excel.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/txt.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/file.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/zip.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/mp3.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/video.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/psd.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/unknown.png
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/image.jpg
   - packages/file_browser/assets/images/morbit_chat_fiile_icon_pdf.png

  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
